# Hello World

This is nothing but me trying out this website, for too long i have avoided the journey of exploring this place and was putting it aside as a side quest. But no more, I shall make this land a prosperous land with riches beyond imaginable with the blessings of the all father Odin, obey me oh peasants of this land, for i came not to destroy thee but rather to build thy homeland.

Signed Ramius Yassinius, Cyrodil.


Quick update: I'm back bi*ches.
